# Prerequisites
- Python 2.7
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git)
- (Optional) [Nervana's Systems neon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/neon.git)
- (Optional) [Nervana's Systems aeon](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/aeon.git)

\* Neon and aeon are required to load data. If other data loader is used, neon and aeon are not required. But, make sure that data format is 'NCHW'.
